Overview
My code is a text-based interactive Python game where you take on the role of a college student navigating academic and social life. Your decisions throughout the semester affect your GPA, stress level, and social points, ultimately leading to one of several unique endings.

Membership Operators (`in`, `not in`)
  Used to validate user input for study subjects and ensure selections are within predefined options.

Logical Operators (`and`, `or`, `not`)
  Used to create complex conditions that affect GPA and social points based on stress levels and subject choices.

Identity Operators (`is`, `is not`)  
  Used for type checking and conditional logic in nested decision structures.

Nested `if` Statements
  Implemented in the weekend activity decision to simulate layered outcomes based on multiple conditions.

How to Run the Game
    You play the game by first putting in your stats then choosing the options given to you until you reach one of the unique endings.
